# Class-Repository-Public (my second attempt at uploading this assignment)
# My name is Leah Airy,
# I have been programing on roblox since I was about 13 years old I believe, and have really enjoyed it so far.
# My hope is to transfer to SDSU for a computer science degree so I can get a job with a video game development company.
# So far though, I am working comfortably in an apartment brokerage. I've been working for about 4 months now, and it's great!
# I just recently got my license after about 2 years of trying, I was very relieved to say the least!
# That's all folks!
